Text-Classification-Problem
===========================
For more information on the text classification (TC) problem I solved see: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/tradeshift-text-classification
I have also written an article on this TC problem (see issues). In the article I review some of the 
commmon approaches to multi-label problems such as TC. I specifically compare two of such methods,
i.e RAKEL and Binary Relevance. Moreover, I explain in the article why RAKEL generally gives good
prediction erros compared to other methods.
