Text-Classification-Problem
===========================
For information on the description of the Text Classification problem (TCP) see:    
https://www.kaggle.com/c/tradeshift-text-classification   
I have written an article on this TCP (see issues). In the article I review some
of the common approaches to multi-label problems such as TC. I specifically compare two of such
methods,i.e RAKEL and Binary Relevance. Moreover, I explain in the article why RAKEL generally gives good
prediction errors compared to other methods.
